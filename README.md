# Face_Detection_From_Newspapers
This is the first project I have done so far!
Originally the code was wriiten for a coursera project and this will be a slightly modified version.
Since this is beginner project, the results are not perfect!
The algorithm is designed to take a zip file containing images and search the word in the images and save the faces in the image that contains the searched word.

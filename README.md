# Face_Detection_From_Newspapers
This is the first project I have done so far!
The algorithm will take a word to search from the newspaper article images in a zip file and print the faces in all of the images.
Originally the code was wriiten for a coursera project and this will be a slightly modified version.
Since this is beginner project, the results are not perfect.
